# A Portfolio Written in a Magical Book! #

This is the very first portfolio I ever made! I usually get way too excited about new projects and bite off more than I can chew, with this one being no exception- originally my grand idea was to have my portfolio be an *interactive magic shop!* Needless to say that was a bit above my head, so I settled for a magical book instead.

### Features ###
The book opens, the pages turn forward (with backwards turning and a functional Table of Contents in a later update), and my contact card pops out of the sleeve in the back. I haven't abandoned my magic shop idea by a longshot though, so keep your eyes peeled for it in the future!
